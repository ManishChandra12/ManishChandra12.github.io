Hi, I'm Manish Chandra. I'm a PhD in Computing Science student at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/). I've completed my M.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) and my B.E. in Computer Science from [Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/). By hobby, I'm a cricket player and a gamer.

My M.Tech. thesis was on the topic of linked-document classification using augmented Graph Convolutional Network. It was accepted in the [short paper track at SIGIR'21](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404835.3463082). My PhD work is on the topic of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), and I'm being supervised by [Dr. Debasis Ganguly](https://gdebasis.github.io/).
